# Waiter-Tips-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
## Objective
Predict waiter tips based on various factors such as bill amount, customer demographics, and dining context.
## Dataset
Restaurant tipping dataset containing attributes like total bill, tip amount, customer gender, smoking status, dining time, day of the week, and party size.
## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Scikit-learn
## Key Tasks
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of tipping patterns
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Training a Linear Regression model for tip prediction
Model evaluation and performance testing
## Insights Gained
Identified key factors influencing tipping behavior (e.g., bill amount, dining time, customer gender)
Visualized tipping trends across different days, meal times, and customer profiles
## Outcome
A machine learning model capable of predicting waiter tips with actionable insights visualized through interactive charts.
